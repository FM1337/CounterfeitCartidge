After my testing had concluded, there wasn't really many updates made to the research. I was busy with school and there wasn't
really anyone else that was having this issue that I could ask to continue testing, and by now the grace period for returning

But I finished the winter semester, had a week off before my work term started and I was bored, so I decided to pick this up once again.
