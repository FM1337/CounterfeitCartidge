        more sense.</p>

            <h3>Getting back to testing</h3>
        </header>
        <p>After my testing had concluded, there wasn't really many updates made to the research. I was busy with school
            and there wasn't
            really anyone else that was having this issue that I could ask to continue testing, and by now the grace
            period for returning
            the cart on Amazon and getting a refund or an exchange was long gone.</p>
        <p>But I finished the winter semester, had a week off before my work term started and I was bored, so I decided
            to pick this up once again.
        </p>
        <p>At this point, I was still operating under the assumption that if the CRC32 Checksum was different from the
            ROM dump on the internet, then the card was a counterfeit.</p>
        <p>
            I decided to re-dump the cart again, but this time grab the trimmed version along with the non-trimmed
            version and check the CRC32s from the internet ROM and this was the result:

        </figure>
        <p>I had also written up a bit about the situation on Discord</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iOLCZG2.png" class="img-fluid">
        <p>If the image doesn't work, below is a transcript of what the text in the image said:</p>
        <pre><code>bit concerning when the CRC32 doesn't match
I mean I understand the trimmed version wouldn't match
but the non-trimmed versions of the same revision and same country should have the same CRC32
I can't find any references to my cart's crc32 version online
while I have found references to the pirated version
which leads me to believe one of three things
1. My cart is a counterfeit
2. Every cart's ROM has a different CRC32
3. The revision or country of my ROM is incorrect
1 and 3 would probably tie together
and 2 is unlikely as hell
This wouldn't be a problem if save exporters wouldn't freak out on my cart,
but everytime I try, they either crash the console, or export a 0 byte save.
and The one that exports the 0 byte save cannot restore any saves I bring in either

            <h3>Getting more info from friends</h3>
        </header>
        <p>For some reason I was dead set on number 2 being wrong, I was proved wrong in the next few minutes by a user
            named TrainBoy2019 on discord who was kind enough to dump his Pokemon diamond cartridge, here are
            screenshots</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="figure">

                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Trimmed ROM</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I quickly updated my earlier graphic showing off the new information discovered</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2D2Ic0O.png" alt="updated image with rom infos"
                 class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Sorry for the low quality picture, I lost the original copy</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Then another kind user named Griffin came along and dumped their Pokemon Diamond cartridge as well and here
            are the results for his dump</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ns1XBTu.png" alt="non-trimmed ROM"
                         class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Non-Trimmed ROM</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KmVpvny.png alt=" image with 3 rom dumps"
                    class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Trimmed ROM</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Right off the bat with these dumps you'll notice something interesting, while the CRC32 of the non-trimmed
            roms don't seem to match, the CRC32 of the trimmed ROMS do match. Both trimmed ROMs have a CRC32 of
            <b>F3B5338E</b> this meant that all ROMs of the game from the same region and revision will most likely have
            a
            different CRC32 if they aren't trimmed.
        </p>
        <p>Griffin and Train both confirmed their carts were legitimate, Griffin had got his copy of the game in 2007
            and Train got his between 2011 and 2013.</p>

            <h3>Input from the CheckPoint Developer</h3>
        </header>
        <p>At this point, the creator of CheckPoint <a href="https://github.com/bernardogiordano">bernardogiordano</a>
            chimes in with a bit of information/a suggestion</p>
        <pre><code>I think that the SPI functions we use in Checkpoint and TWLSaveTool don't know what to do with your cart
Check with FBI just to see</code></pre>
        <p>So I decided to try his suggestion, and the results weren't pretty, I recorded a YouTube video with the
            results which you can see below</p>

            <h3>The conclusion...for now</h3>
        </header>
        <p>And that my friends, is pretty much the conclusion of this story, there's no real happy ending to it just
            yet, I haven't found any thing that works so far but I'm not giving up. If you wanna see what I've tried so
            far you can do that by clicking ~~here~~ (Coming soon).
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading the story up till now and I hope in the future we'll find a solution.</p>
