# How I discovered this cart was a "counterfeit"
(Side note if you haven't read the first part, you can do so by [clicking here](https://fm1337.github.io/CounterfeitCartidge/story/obtain/
))

So quoting one area in the previous part of the story
```
I got home booted it up and it worked fine. I could save and play the game without any issues that I could see.
```

This part still remains true, there isn't any issues with playing through the game like normal:
- Saving works fine
- Gameplay is normal with no issues
- The cartridge is reconized like a legit copy of Pokemon Diamond
- The cartidge itself doesn't show any signs of being a counterfeit/bootleg

So if there were no issues with the game itself at all, why am I calling it a counterfeit?

Well, it's because I discovered issues with interacting with the cart because of lazyness. See I didn't want to have to play
through Pokemon again just to transfer over Pokemon to the pokebank so I decided to try importing a save file from the internet
onto the cartidge.

So my first go to solution was [CheckPoint](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint) a save manager utiliary created by bernardogiordano
