# How I came across/obtained the cartidge

In November of 2017 a month after purchasing my first Nintendo 2DS and installing custom firmware on it
I wanted to try and get Pokemon that I had on a flash cart into the Pokebank.

Only problem was, I couldn't directly import them from a flash cart to the bank and I couldn't use the poke transfer lab in
Pokemon white with a flash cart (because of it using ds download play), so my next best option was to obtain a generation 4
cartridge of Pokemon (Pokemon Diamond to Heart Gold).

So I started asking around, I asked my friends if they had any cartridges
they'd be willing to sell me, I called stores like GameStop/EB Games, I even went to some vintage gaming stores, and the only
store that was selling a generation 4 game (Pokemon HeartGold in this case) was asking $50 + tax for the game which would've
cost me $57, keep in mind it was only the cartridge, no case and no pokewalker.

Not willing to spend $57 on a used copy with a lot of the items missing, I took to Amazon to try and find a game.
Right away I managed to find a copy of Pokemon diamond being sold for $29.97 by a seller named ["eMerchant3000"](https://www.amazon.ca/sp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=&isAmazonFulfilled=0&isCBA=&marketplaceID=A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2&seller=A32W5WL4L2GKXU&tab=&vasStoreID= "Amazon") from Ontario.
Of course, I checked the ratings this seller had, and nothing seemed out of place so I order the cartridge and it arrived on December 4th 2017.

It arrived in a cheap small plastic ziploc bag (as the seller had stated they didn't have the original case for it), I got home booted it up and it worked fine.
I could save and play the game without any issues that I could see.

Of course, like always there is something that is different than what meets the eye
