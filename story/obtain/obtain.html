            <h3>How it began</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In November of 2017 a month after purchasing my first Nintendo 2DS and installing custom firmware on it
            I wanted to try and get Pokemon that I had on a flash cart into the PokeBank.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Only problem was, I couldn't directly import them from a flash cart to the bank and I couldn't use the poke
            transfer lab in
            Pokemon white with a flash cart (because of it using ds download play), so my next best option was to obtain
            a generation 4
            cartridge of Pokemon (Pokemon Diamond to Heart Gold).
        </p>
        <p>So I started asking around, I asked my friends if they had any cartridges
            they'd be willing to sell me, I called stores like GameStop/EB Games, I even went to some vintage gaming
            stores, and the only
            store that was selling a generation 4 game (Pokemon HeartGold in this case) was asking $50 + tax for the
            game which would've
            cost me $57, keep in mind it was only the cartridge, no case and no PokeWalker.</p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Not willing to spend $57 on a used copy with a lot of the items missing, I took to Amazon to try and find a
            game.
            Right away I managed to find a copy of Pokemon diamond being sold for $29.97 by a seller named
            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/sp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=&isAmazonFulfilled=0&isCBA=&marketplaceID=A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2&seller=A32W5WL4L2GKXU&tab=&vasStoreID=
            " title="Amazon">eMerchant3000</a> from Ontario.
            Of course, I checked the ratings this seller had, and nothing seemed out of place so I order the</p>
        <p>It arrived in a cheap small plastic ziploc bag (as the seller had stated they didn't have the original case
            for it), I got home booted it up and it worked fine.
            I could save and play the game without any issues that I could see.</p>
        <p>Of course, like always there is something that is different than what meets the eye
