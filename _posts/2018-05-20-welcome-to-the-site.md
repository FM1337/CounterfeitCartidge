This website will be used to document the information I have discovered about the counterfeit
Pokemon Diamond cartridge I bought over Amazon.

It will also be used to provide information about other Nintendo DS (or 3DS) counterfeit cards found by other
people if they request their findings be added to the site.

If you'd like to provide information about any counterfeit carts you have, post an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/FM1337/CounterfeitCartidge/issues)
